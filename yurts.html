The Yurts at Pacific Trails

</h2>

<dl>

<dt><strong>What is a yurt?</strong></dt>

<dd>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt has canvas walls, a wooden

floor, and a roof dome that can be opened, and a private deck.</dd>

<dt><strong>How are the yurts furnished?</strong></dt>

<dd>Each yurt is furnished with a gas fireplace, king-size bed with down quilt, comfy couch, dining table and chairs,<br>
    mini-fridge, microwave, and coffee maker. Your luxury camping experience includes a sink with hot and cold running water.<br>
    Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.
</dd>

<dt><strong>What should I bring?</strong></dt>

<dd>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with light layers of clothing. It's<br>
also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!<br><br></dd>
